<!--
  Tab template: Warnings (docs/js/tabs/warnings.js)
  Purpose: Placeholder surface for production warnings and manual notes.
  JS entry points:
    • Hydrated purely so the module can register the tab; there are no dynamic selectors yet.
  Dynamic elements:
    • Copy is static today but the tab script may insert warning items in future revisions.
  Hydration notes:
    • Maintained primarily for parity with other tabs—the module simply hydrates to mark the panel as ready.
    • Container classes align with layout spacing utilities shared across tabs.

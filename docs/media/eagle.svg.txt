Placeholder for eagle.svg asset.

Please add a vector image named `eagle.svg` in this directory. The SVG should depict the stylized eagle used for the flight animation that travels across the calculator viewport when inch units are selected.

Once you have the final artwork, replace this file with the real `eagle.svg` asset while keeping the same filename.
